## DATABASE DESCRIPTION FOR - HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
--------------------------------------------------

Our database management system project encompasses a Hotel Management System with distinct modules for both administrators and customers. Both modules facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The customer module empowers users to view their profiles, create reservations, verify room availability and access receipt information. Simultaneously, the admin module allows administrators to view their profiles, 
manage room additions or deletions, and verify room availability.
